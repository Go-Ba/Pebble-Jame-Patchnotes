# v1.2.2
### Score for the spooky mode will be reset for this update

In order to rebalance the spooky gamemode, I've made the "negative" pebbles more punishing to avoid what were essentially infinite loops in scoring where you remove the biggest pebbles to make more space without impacting score.

Pebbles now keep track of the score they have created and that score will be lost if it is destroyed. Destroying brand new balls that have never been fused doesn't affect score

I've also made changes to stop crazy buildup of too many cats

## Changes
- bandages now slightly fade in instead of instantly appearing
- jester pebble now removes some score similar to the skull pebble
- cat pebbles now despawn after a set amount of pebbles have been dropped
- cat pebbles are now slightly larger

## Bug Fixes
- skull pebble now removes the correct amount of points, it was removing just the score of the most recent fusion
- skull pebbles no longer trigger bombs
- attempted to fix rare crash with mummy pebble
